# Excelior

Excelior is a [**mafia.gg bot**](https://www.mafia.gg) designed for me to experiment with WebSocket communications and authentication methods. This bot connects to mafia.gg and automatically joins a room, allowing interaction with the game through user-ran commands in the ingame chat. I initially adopted a Selenium-based approach but due to the open window and slow bot response times, I decided to learn more about WebSockets and how they work.

## Features

- ðŸ”Œ **WebSocket Client** â€“ Handles real-time communication with Mafia.gg via websockets
- ðŸ”‘ **Authentication System** â€“ Manages user authentication for secure connections
- ðŸ“œ **Command Scalability** â€“ Easily scale up commands as you want
- ðŸ›  **Modular Structure** â€“ Designed for easy expansion and customisation

## Installation

Clone the repository and install dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/CypherGuy/excelior.git
cd excelior
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Modify settings.json to include your authentication details and room ID:

```json
{
    "token": "your_token_here",
    "userid": "your_userid_here",
    "room_id": "optional_room_id"
}
```

Add a .env file, and put in your username, password and auth token

```env
USERNAME = 'username'
PASSWORD = 'password'
AUTH_TOKEN = 'authtoken'
```

then run the bot
```
python main.py
```

In the terminal you can give it a URL to connect to a specific room URL, or it will find the first one available and join it.

## File Structure

```
excelior/
â”‚â”€â”€ auth.py               # Handles authentication
â”‚â”€â”€ commands.py           # Defines bot commands
â”‚â”€â”€ helper_functions.py   # Utility functions
â”‚â”€â”€ main.py               # Main bot logic
â”‚â”€â”€ websocket_client.py   # WebSocket client implementation
â”‚â”€â”€ settings.json         # Configuration file
â”‚â”€â”€ requirements.txt      # Dependencies
â”‚â”€â”€ .gitignore            # Git ignore rules
```

I would also highly recommend you put in a .env file for you to put your bot's username, password and auth token.
